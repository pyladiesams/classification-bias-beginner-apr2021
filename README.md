# An introduction to Classification Bias
### Level: Beginner
### Presentation: https://github.com/pyladiesams/classification-bias-beginner-apr2021/blob/master/PyLadies_Bias_2021.pdf

## Workshop description
AI error and bias have critical impact on people and society. For instance, certain sub-population may be systematically misclassified, and thus discriminated. All impacted people should be able to scrutinise AI bias, even people with little AI expertise.

In this workshop, we introduce the basic concepts & methods needed to inspect classification bias, and the different types of bias to inspect. We build and compare classifiers with just a few lines of code. We use simplified visualizations that remain accessible to people with little AI expertise, yet allow to inspect all types of bias.
